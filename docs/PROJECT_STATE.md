## Frontend

| Item | State |
|------|-------|
| Stack | Expo SDK ~54, React Native 0.81, React 19, Expo Router ~6, TypeScript ~5.9 |
| Auth | Connected — login, register, refresh, secure-store tokens |
| Navigation | 6-tab bottom bar (Home, Workout, Nutrition, Coach, Progress, Profile) |
| Design system | Token-based theme with light/dark/system preference (`ThemeContext`) |
| Feature modules | coach, workout, nutrition, progress, analytics, home, dashboard, profile, shared; plus AI/training domains below |
| Data layer | Service factory pattern; user/workout backend providers; on-device workout history via `WorkoutHistoryRepository` + `StorageAdapter` (Sprint 13.0); analytics via `WorkoutAnalyticsRepository` (Sprint 14.0) |
| Backend providers | `BackendUserService`, `BackendWorkoutService` live; other `Backend*Service` classes throw `notConfigured()` |
| Tests | Jest + jest-expo |
| Sprint status | History + detail shipped (13.1–13.2); workout analytics foundation (14.0); AI workout pipeline foundations through Training Adaptation (17.1–17.5) |

## Mobile AI / Training Domains (Application Layer)

| Domain | Module | Maturity |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Conversation | `features/conversation` | Foundation complete |
| Workflow | `features/workflow` | Foundation complete |
| Memory | conversation persistence adapters | Foundation complete |
| Prompt Orchestrator | `features/prompt-orchestrator` | Foundation complete |
| Tool Engine | `features/tool-calling` | Foundation complete |
| Athlete Context | `features/athlete-context` | Foundation complete |
| Workout Blueprint | `features/workout-blueprint` | Foundation complete (17.0) |
| Exercise Knowledge Base | `features/exercise-kb` | Foundation complete (17.1) — read-only, in-memory |
| Exercise Selection | `features/exercise-selection` | Foundation complete (17.2) — deterministic |
| Programming | `features/programming` | Foundation complete (17.3) — prescriptions only |
| Progression | `features/progression` | Foundation complete (17.4) — multi-week timeline only |
| Training Adaptation | `features/training-adaptation` | Foundation complete (17.5) — readiness + recommendations only |
| Workout Assembly | — | **Not started** (17.6) |
| Program Generation | — | **Not started** (17.7) |

These domains are TypeScript application modules with in-memory repositories. They are **not** backend HTTP APIs and do **not** write to PostgreSQL.

## Backend

| Item | State |
|------|-------|
| Stack | FastAPI 0.116, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Pydantic 2.11, Uvicorn |
| Architecture | Clean Architecture enforced — routes thin, logic in services |
| Domains live | Auth, users, exercises, catalog, workouts (templates), workout logs, workout resolution, nutrition, recovery, coach, goals, progress |
| API endpoints | **56 implemented**, **6 planned** ([API_STATUS.md](./API_STATUS.md)) |
| Missing HTTP APIs | Program/workout authoring & assignment, exercise writes, conversation list |
| Entry point | `GET /` health stub; no `/health` with DB check |
| OpenAPI | Auto-generated at `/docs`, `/redoc` |

---

## AI

| Item | State |
|------|-------|
| Orchestrator | Complete — intent routing, memory, persistence |
| Registered engines | WorkoutCoach, NutritionCoach, RecoveryCoach |
| Rule-based engines | NutritionEngine, RecoveryEngine (no LLM) |
| Progress Analyzer | Complete — hybrid stats + LLM narrative; REST only, not Coach-bound |
| LLM providers | `mock` (default), `openai_compatible` (OpenAI SDK + configurable base URL) |
| Intent classification | LLM-primary with keyword fallback |
| Memory | Windowed conversation context; summarization deferred |
| Mobile AI | MockCoachService working; OpenAI/Anthropic/Local LLM are placeholders |
| Mobile workout pipeline | Blueprint → Knowledge → Selection → Programming → Progression → Adaptation foundations complete; assembly planned |

---

## Database

| Item | State |
|------|-------|
| Engine | PostgreSQL 17 (Docker Compose locally) |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.x declarative |
| Migrations | 10 Alembic versions applied |
| Tables | users, exercises, muscle_groups, equipment, programs, workouts, workout_logs, meals, recovery_check_ins, conversations, chat_messages, goals, progress_entries |
| Seeds | Exercise catalog via `database/seeds/seed_exercises.py`; default beginner program via `database/seeds/seed_default_program.py` (Sprint 6.3.1) |

---

## Authentication

| Layer | State |
|-------|-------|
| Backend | JWT (HS256), Argon2 passwords, stateless sessions |
| Endpoints | `POST /auth/register`, `/login`, `/refresh`; `GET /users/me`; `PATCH /users/me` |
| Mobile | `expo-secure-store` for tokens; 401 → refresh → retry-once |
| Gaps | No role enum (uses `is_superuser`) |

---

## Testing

| Layer | State |
|-------|-------|
| Backend unit | 19 files — services, engines, orchestrator, intent, LLM provider |
| Backend integration | 11 files — real PostgreSQL via pytest fixtures (incl. workout templates, workout log skip) |
| Backend runner | pytest 9.1 + pytest-asyncio |
| Mobile | Jest + Testing Library — auth, API client, screens, feature architecture, Workout backend service/adapters; plus domain suites for exercise-kb (6), exercise-selection (8), programming (7) |
| CI pipeline | **Not configured** (no `.github/workflows`) |

---

## Deployment

| Item | State |
|------|-------|
| Local DB | `docker-compose.yml` — PostgreSQL only |
| Backend container | Dockerfile referenced in architecture; **not in repo root backend/** |
| Production compose | Planned under `docker/` — **not present** |
| Infrastructure as Code | Planned under `infrastructure/` — **not present** |
| CI/CD | **Not started** |
| Secrets | `.env.example` templates exist; no managed secrets store |

## Known Issues

See [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](./KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for the full list.

**Highlights (open):**
- Mobile backend providers not wired for coach/nutrition (Sprint 5.3) — Workout wired in Sprint 6.3
- No program management HTTP API; workout template *authoring* (write) HTTP API still missing (reads live since Sprint 6.3)
- No CI pipeline or backend Docker service
- `docs/TASKS.md` Phase 1–2 checkboxes out of sync with code
- AI workout pipeline stops at Training Adaptation — no workout assembly or program generation yet

---

## Last Completed Sprint

**17.5.0 — Training Adaptation Engine Foundation** (2026-07-22)

- `features/training-adaptation` evaluates `ProgressionPlan` readiness and emits immutable adaptation recommendations
- Assessments: recovery, fatigue, constraint, execution readiness; strategies: volume, intensity, swap, recovery day, schedule
- In-memory repository cache; application use-cases; unit tests — recommendations only; no wearables, athlete history, physiological APIs, workout modification, UI, or networking

Previous: **17.4.0 — Progression Engine Foundation**, **17.3.0 — Programming Engine Foundation**, **17.2.0 — Exercise Selection Engine Foundation**, **17.1.0 — Exercise Knowledge Base Foundation**, **17.0.0 — Workout Blueprint Generator Foundation**

---

## Next Sprint

**17.6.0 — Workout Assembly** — assemble complete executable workouts; still no program generation.
