# Architecture Decision Records

This document records significant technical decisions made for EVOLVE, why they were made, and what alternatives were considered. New decisions should be appended with the next sequential number — existing entries are not renumbered or deleted, even if later superseded (mark superseded decisions explicitly).

Format inspired by lightweight ADRs (Architecture Decision Records).

## Decision 001 — Use FastAPI as the Backend Framework

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
EVOLVE needs a Python backend framework capable of serving a versioned REST API, validating input rigorously, generating accurate API documentation, and eventually supporting async workloads (AI orchestration, background jobs).

**Decision:**
Adopt **FastAPI** as the sole web framework for the backend.

**Why:**
- **Native async support** — well-suited for I/O-bound operations (database calls, future AI/LLM calls) without blocking the event loop.
- **Pydantic-native validation** — request/response schemas are enforced automatically and double as living API documentation.
- **Automatic OpenAPI generation** — `/docs` and `/redoc` are available with zero extra tooling, which matters for a fast-moving early-stage project.
- **Dependency injection model** — fits Clean Architecture cleanly (`get_db`, `get_current_user` as composable dependencies) without a heavy DI framework.
- **Strong ecosystem and performance** — built on Starlette/Uvicorn, production-proven, minimal overhead versus Flask/Django for API-only workloads.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Django REST Framework** — more batteries-included but heavier, and its ORM-centric, synchronous-by-default design conflicts with the async, AI-heavy direction of EVOLVE.
- **Flask** — simpler but requires manually assembling validation, async support, and OpenAPI generation — more integration work for the same result.

**Consequences:**
- The team commits to Pydantic v2 for all schema validation.
- Async endpoints are the default expectation for I/O-bound routes, particularly those touching AI engines.

## Decision 002 — Use PostgreSQL as the Primary Database

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
EVOLVE's domain includes highly relational data (users, programs, workouts, exercises, goals) as well as semi-structured data (AI memory snapshots, chat metadata, coaching context). The database must support strong consistency for transactional fitness data while remaining flexible enough for evolving AI-related structures.

**Decision:**
Adopt **PostgreSQL** as the sole primary datastore.

**Why:**
- **ACID guarantees** — critical for user accounts, logged workouts, and progress data where consistency matters.
- **Rich relational modeling** — fitness domain data (users → programs → workouts → exercises) is naturally relational with many foreign-key relationships.
- **JSON/JSONB support** — allows flexible storage for AI-related metadata (chat context, engine outputs) without needing a second database technology.
- **Mature ecosystem** — first-class support in SQLAlchemy and Alembic, wide availability as a managed service across cloud providers.
- **Proven scalability path** — read replicas, connection pooling, and partitioning are all well-understood for PostgreSQL when the platform grows.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **MongoDB** — flexible schema is appealing for AI data, but sacrifices relational integrity for core fitness domain entities where it matters most (users, programs, progress).
- **MySQL** — comparable relational capabilities, but weaker native JSON support and a less feature-rich extension ecosystem than PostgreSQL for this use case.

**Consequences:**
- One database technology serves both structured domain data and semi-structured AI context, avoiding polyglot persistence complexity in the early phases.
- JSONB columns may be used for AI metadata, but core entities remain fully relational.

## Decision 003 — Use SQLAlchemy 2.x as the ORM

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The backend needs a way to map Python objects to PostgreSQL tables while keeping database logic isolated from business logic (per Clean Architecture) and supporting type-safe, testable code.

**Decision:**
Adopt **SQLAlchemy 2.x** (declarative style) as the exclusive ORM.

**Why:**
- **Mature and PostgreSQL-native** — deep support for PostgreSQL-specific features (JSONB, arrays, constraints) if/when needed.
- **2.x style improves type safety** — `Mapped[]` and `mapped_column()` integrate with type checkers, aligning with the "always use type hints" principle in `evolve.mdc`.
- **Works seamlessly with Alembic** — the same models that define application structure drive migration generation, keeping schema and code in sync.
- **Fits the repository pattern** — SQLAlchemy's `Session` object is easily wrapped behind repository classes, keeping queries out of services and routes.
- **Avoids raw SQL** — as mandated by `evolve.mdc`, SQLAlchemy's query builder covers the vast majority of needs without hand-written SQL.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Raw SQL / `asyncpg` directly** — faster to write initially but forfeits type safety, migration tooling, and maintainability as the schema grows.
- **Tortoise ORM** — async-native and lighter weight, but a smaller ecosystem and weaker Alembic-equivalent migration tooling compared to SQLAlchemy.

**Consequences:**
- All models live under `models/` using SQLAlchemy 2.x declarative syntax.
- Raw SQL is disallowed unless explicitly required and justified, per project rules.

## Decision 004 — Use Alembic for Schema Migrations

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The database schema will evolve continuously across six roadmap phases. Ad-hoc schema creation (e.g., `Base.metadata.create_all()`) is unsafe for production: it provides no history, no rollback path, and no coordination across environments or team members.

**Decision:**
Adopt **Alembic** as the exclusive schema migration tool, replacing any `create_all()`-based schema management.

**Why:**
- **Native SQLAlchemy integration** — Alembic reads the same declarative models used by the application, minimizing drift between code and schema.
- **Versioned, reviewable history** — every schema change is a file in version control, reviewable in pull requests like any other code change.
- **Rollback support** — `downgrade()` paths allow safe recovery from a bad deployment.
- **Environment parity** — the same migration chain runs identically in development, staging, and production, which `create_all()` cannot guarantee.
- **Required by CI/CD** — the planned deployment pipeline (Phase 6) runs migrations automatically before deploying new application code; this requires a real migration tool, not implicit schema creation.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **`Base.metadata.create_all()` only** — sufficient for early prototyping (and used transiently before Alembic was configured) but explicitly disallowed for ongoing development because it cannot alter existing tables or provide rollback.
- **Django-style migrations** — not applicable outside Django; would require adopting Django, contradicting Decision 001.

**Consequences:**
- No schema changes are made via `create_all()` in application startup code.
- Every model change must be accompanied by a corresponding Alembic migration in the same pull request.

## Decision 005 — Use Docker and Docker Compose for Local and Deployment Environments

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
EVOLVE needs a consistent way to run PostgreSQL and the backend API across developer machines, CI, and eventually production, without "works on my machine" drift.

**Decision:**
Adopt **Docker** for containerization and **Docker Compose** for local multi-service orchestration.

**Why:**
- **Environment parity** — the same container image that runs locally can run in CI and production, minimizing environment-specific bugs.
- **Zero-install onboarding** — new contributors only need Docker installed to get PostgreSQL (and eventually the API) running, rather than manually installing and configuring PostgreSQL locally.
- **Multi-service composition** — Docker Compose cleanly expresses the dependency between the API and PostgreSQL (and later, additional services such as Redis or AI workers) in one declarative file.
- **Smooth path to production** — the same Dockerfile used in development is hardened (multi-stage build) for production deployment, rather than requiring a rewrite.
- **Cloud-agnostic** — containers run on any container-friendly platform (ECS, Cloud Run, Fly.io, Kubernetes), keeping the infrastructure decision in Phase 6 open per `EVOLVE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Bare-metal / manually installed services** — faster to start with no Docker overhead, but reintroduces "works on my machine" problems and complicates onboarding and CI parity.
- **Vagrant / VM-based environments** — heavier resource footprint than containers with no meaningful benefit for this use case.

**Consequences:**
- `docker-compose.yml` is the canonical way to run the local development stack.
- Production deployment (Phase 6) will use a multi-stage Dockerfile and equivalent container orchestration in the cloud.
